a. 
```
int num = 0;
Semophore mutex(1);

void main() {
    while(num < n) {    // n is the total number of people
        int sock = new_person();
        thread_fork(handler, sock);
    }
}

void counter(int sock) {
    mutex.wait();
    if (sock > 0)   // there is a person arrives
        num++;
    mutex.signal();
    close(sock);
}

## Problem 2
a. We are implementing a read-modify-write operation, data race may occur, resulting in wrong number of votes.

b. First way: when a machine is processing votes, we lock it and pause the other machines. After it finishes adding the new votes to the shared counter, we unlock it, and pass the lock to the next machine in the wait queue.
Second way: Instead of delaying all the threads, we perform atomic operations. In this case, one thread only needs to wait until the current atomic operation complete.

c. No. 
We update the shared counter periodically. Every time we add the value from a local counter to the global one, we clear that local counter to 0. As long as there are time gaps between two updates, synchroniztion is not needed.

d. In c, we don't need a lock to perform synchroniztion, but polling wastes time if there is no new coming votes.
In b, we decrease the delay caused by accessing shared memory to the least, though we need a lock to implement atomic operations.

## Problem 3
In this case, intersections are resources that need to be allocated. The red cars are processes that are accesssing critical section.
Yes, this is deadlock.
1. Non-preemptive: cars need to wait in line to pass the intersections one by one.
2. Mutual exclusion: when the red cars are passing intersections, other cars are not able to go into intersections.
3. Hold and wait: The red cars are at intersections, while waiting for the cars in front, which are waiting at the next intersection.
4. Circular wait: Cars are waiting at the intersections at their counter-clockwise direction.

## Problem 4
a. We can use Banker's Algorithm to simulate.
1. A car can go into the intersection only if the next intersection is also available. If not, switch the traffic light to red.
2. After 5 cars passed one intersection, switch the traffic light, and lock that direction and let the cars from the other direction pass.

```
int num = 0;
Semophore intersection(5);
Semophore light(0);
Semophore mutex(1);

void car() {                // thread for one car at one intersection
    intersection.wait();
    mutex.wait();
    go_into_intersection();
    num++;
    mutex.signal();
    if (num >= 5) {
        clear(num);
        light.signal();
    }
}


void switchTrafficLight() {       // thread for one traffic light's decision
    light.wait();
    switch_traffic_light();
    intersection.signal();
    intersection.signal();
    intersection.signal();
    intersection.signal();
    intersection.signal();
}
```

b. We can add preemption to the above mechanism. When there comes an emergency car in a direction, the other cars in that direction should stop immediately, and the emergency car would have the highest priority to the intersection.
